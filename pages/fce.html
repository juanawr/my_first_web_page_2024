                    <h2>Course Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Provides students with a global understanding of Computer Engineering, including 
                        its foundations in mathematics, physics, anthropology, and ethics. The course is 
                        divided into two parts: theoretical foundations and practical skills development. 
                        The first part covers Computer Engineering in Society, Information and Data, and 
                        Information Processing, Management, and Transmission. The second part introduces 
                        web development and soft-skills like teamwork, ethical commitment, and communication 
                        skills, promoting comprehensive training for computer engineers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course explains the terminology and historical events surrounding the emergence 
                        and evolution of computers and computer science. It also covers the fundamental aspects 
                        of hardware, software, and networks, as well as the creation of a web system for 
                        information dissemination and the presentation of a computer project.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gain knowledge of Computer Engineering objectives, principles, human element, 
                        global vision, career paths, and current paradigms to understand the field's value, 
                        contribute to society, and understand professional profiles.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Activities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aims to facilitate student learning of fundamental concepts and techniques through 
                        face-to-face sessions, independent work, and non-face-to-face activities. It promotes 
                        collaborative learning, self-learning abilities, and effective communication skills. 
                        Students are required to present their findings in class, promoting knowledge exchange 
                        and synthesis abilities. An online learning platform called Canvas is used for access 
                        to materials, work planning, and communication with professors and other students.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        Students must demonstrate knowledge and understanding in a general secondary education area, 
                        apply it professionally, and possess skills in problem-solving, data gathering, and communication. 
                        They must be able to make judgments, address social, scientific, or ethical issues, and 
                        communicate ideas to both expert and non-expert audiences. They must also develop independent 
                        learning skills for further study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The individual possesses the ability to design, develop, and maintain computer systems, services, 
                        and applications using engineering methods in software for quality control. They have knowledge 
                        of basic materials and technologies, computer programming, and their application in engineering problems.
                    </p>
